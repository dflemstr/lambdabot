Known bugs and silliness:
* L.hs gets copied to the main directory from State/ by something
  and this requires import.h to be present in both places. It would
  be worthwhile to simplify whatever the heck is going on there.
** This is caused, I believe, by 'comp' in Eval.hs. This may or may not be fixed.
   At the least, import.h has been copied into Pristine.hs and so is unused in State/ now.
